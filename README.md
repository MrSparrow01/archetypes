# Archetypes
This test will help you identify your archetype.

# How it works
In total, the test has 72 questions written to a JSON file. The main goal was to write a code that would randomly create an array of questions and then display them on the user's page in blocks of 6 questions. After clicking the "Continue" button, the block of questions is updated without refreshing the page.

# Further development
In future updates, the ability to identify via Telegram or email will be added.
